Network Macros are organization wide defined macros that can be used as a destination of a policy rule. For instance, you can create a network that represents your internal Intranet access, and use it as a destination of a policy rule to drop any packet that is coming from a particular port. Macros can now be created under SaaS Application Types. SaaS Application Types can then be associated to a SaaS Application Group which can be used as a destination of a policy rule.

- ``netmask``: Netmask of the subnet defined

- ``embedded_metadata``: Metadata objects associated with this entity. This will contain a list of Metadata objects if the API request is made using the special flag to enable the embedded Metadata feature. Only a maximum of Metadata objects is returned based on the value set in the system configuration.

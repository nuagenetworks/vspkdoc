.. class:: nuingressacltemplate.NUIngressACLTemplate(bambou.nurest_object.NUMetaRESTObject,):

An ingress security policy is a set of rules defining how network traffic is treated within a domain. Ingress Security Policies control traffic flowing into the network.


Attributes
----------


- ``name`` (**Mandatory**): The name of the entity

- ``last_updated_by``: ID of the user who last updated the object.

- ``last_updated_date``: Time stamp when this object was last updated.

- ``active``: If enabled, it means that this ACL or QOS entry is active

- ``default_allow_ip``: If enabled a default ACL of Allow All is added as the last entry in the list of ACL entries

- ``default_allow_non_ip``: If enabled, non IP Traffic will be allowed

- ``description``: A description of the entity

- ``allow_address_spoof``: If enabled, it will disable the default anti-spoof ACL for this domain that essentially prevents any VM to send packets that do not originate from that particular VM

- ``embedded_metadata``: Metadata objects associated with this entity. This will contain a list of Metadata objects if the API request is made using the special flag to enable the embedded Metadata feature. Only a maximum of Metadata objects is returned based on the value set in the system configuration.

- ``entity_scope``: Specify if scope of entity is Data center or Enterprise level

- ``policy_state``: None

- ``creation_date``: Time stamp when this object was created.

- ``priority``: The priority of the ACL entry that determines the order of entries

- ``priority_type``: Possible values: TOP, BOTTOM, TOP_FIREWALL, BOTTOM_FIREWALL, MIDDLE_FIREWALL or NONE. TOP and BOTTOM ACL policies can only be defined and managed on the template level, NONE can be used on both the template and instantiated level. TOP_FIREWALL, BOTTOM_FIREWALL, MIDDLE_FIREWALL are used to represent acls dirived from Virtual Firewall Policies. These allow for careful control of ACL priority handling.

- ``associated_live_entity_id``: In the draft mode, the ACL entry refers to this LiveEntity. In non-drafted mode, this is null.

- ``associated_virtual_firewall_policy_id``: The ID of the Virtual Firewall Policy, if this was created as part of the Virtual Firewall Policy creation

- ``auto_generate_priority``: This option only affects how the children ACL entry priorities of this template/policy are generated when the priority is not specified. If 'false', the priority is generated by incrementing the current highest ACL Entry priority by 100. If 'true', a random priority will be generated, which is advised when creating many entries concurrently without specifying the priority. This will cause the new child ACL entry to get a random, non-predictable, priority. Therefore it is advised to only enable this when allow rules are being created. If any type of ACL entry order is required, keep this value to 'false' and use your own defined priorities, this will make sure there is a clear set of priorities and how traffic is validated against the ACL entries.

- ``owner``: Identifies the user that has created this object.

- ``external_id``: External object ID. Used for integration with third party systems
